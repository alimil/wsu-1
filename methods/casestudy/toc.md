# Case study: Aproaches and Methods of anslysies of finsncial time serial data.

The application of quantitative methods in finance has greatly increased in recent years because of the data being collected and are available over internet, some data is free for other one have access after paying some fee. Data are collected for many variables in a number of countries and at a finest timescale available. Computing resources are available in the forms of public cloud: AWS, Google Compute. The statistical packages for analyzing financial data are available for free as open source, for example: R. The availability threshold has lowered givig the possibility of application to wider audience. 
To succsesfully apply analyse and forecast behaviour of market instruments the number of statisstical methods were developed in recent years. We'll review several methods and consider define critera to measure performance of differnt methods.

## Defenitions and components of Time Series
The ability to forecast a temporal sequence of data into the future is critical in many industries: finance, transportation and manufacturing are a few examples.

### Stationarity

 $$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$

 
## Finansial Time Series Characteristics
The studies of financial time series mostly involve returns, instead of prices. For some investors, return of an asset is a simplest summary of the investment opportunity. Second, return series are easier to handle than price series because the returns have more attractive statistical properties[4].

### Asset returns
Let _P<sub>t</sub>_ be the _price_ of an asset at time index _t_. We discuss some definitions of returns that are used throughout the book.

#### One-Period Simple Return

The asset beeing hold for one period from date t − 1 to date t would result in a _simple gross return_
* __1+R<sub>t</sub>= P<sub>t</sub>__  or  __P<sub>t</sub>=P<sub>t-1</sub>(1+R<sub>t</sub>)__

The corresponding one-period _simple net return_ or _simple return_ is
* __R<sub>t</sub>= (P<sub>t</sub>/P<sub>t−1</sub>) - 1 =  (P<sub>t</sub> - P<sub>t−1</sub>)/P<sub>t−1</sub>__



## Box-Jenkins Methodology
## Measure of performance of the forecasts
## Applied analysis with R: libraries available
### ARIMA
### SVM
### ANN
## Example plan for Log return analisys of daily time series
