##(Question #10 from chapter 4)

This question should be answered using the Weekly data set, which is part of the ISLR package. This data is similar in nature to the Smarket data from this chapter’s lab, except that it contains 1089 weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2010.
```R
> library (ISLR)
> names(Weekly)
[1] "Year"      "Lag1"      "Lag2"      "Lag3"      "Lag4"      "Lag5"      "Volume"    "Today"     "Direction"

```
### (a) Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the Weekly data. Do there appear to be any patterns?
```R

 ```
 
 Draw the correlation matrix

```R
pairs(Weekly [,1:8])
```

![pairs(Weekly [,1:8])](Rplot2-1.svg)

```R
> plot(Volume)
```

![plot(Volume)](Rplot14.svg)

Volume corelates to the week number. Other relations are not so clear.


### (b) Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with Direction as the response and the five lag variables plus Volume as predictors. Use the summary function to print the results. Do any of the predictors appear to be statistically significant? If so, which ones?

```R
> glm.fits=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume , data=Weekly ,family=binomial)
> summary (glm.fits)

Call:
glm(formula = Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + 
    Volume, family = binomial, data = Weekly)

Deviance Residuals: 
    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  
-1.6949  -1.2565   0.9913   1.0849   1.4579  

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)

    Null deviance: 1496.2  on 1088  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance: 1486.4  on 1082  degrees of freedom
AIC: 1500.4

Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4

```

**The `Lag2` appears to be the predictor that contribute the most.**

### (c) Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression.

```R
> glm.pred =predict(glm.fits,type ="response")
> contrasts(Direction)
     Up
Down  0
Up    1
> glm.prob=rep ("Down" ,1089)
> glm.prob[glm.pred >.5]="Up"
> ## 
> table(glm.prob,Direction )
        Direction
glm.prob Down  Up
    Down   54  48
    Up    430 557
>
```
Interpretation:
```
| Direction |                |                 |      |
| glm.prob  | Down           | Up              |      |
| Down      | True Down=  54 | False Down=  48 |  102 |
| Up        | False Up=  430 | True Up=    557 |  987 |
| totals    | 484            | 605             | 1089 |
```

* Accuracy: Overall, how often is the classifier correct?
(True Down +True Up)/total = (54+557)/1089 = 0.56
__The ~56% of time the classifier able to accuratly predict.__

* Misclassification Rate: Overall, how often is it wrong?
(Fase Down + False Up)/total = (430+48)/1089 = 0.44
__Error Rate is ~44%. It is also (1 - Accuracy)__

* True Positive Rate: When it's actually __Up__, how often does it predict __Up__?
True Down/actual Down = 557/987 = 0.56
__It is 56%. This value is also known as "Sensitivity" or "Recall"__

* False Positive Rate: When it's actually __Down__, how often does it predict __Up__?
FP/actual  = 48/102 = 0.47
__It is 47%__

* True Negative Rate (also known as "Specificity"): When it's actually __Down__, how often does it predict __Down__?
TN/actual no = 54/102 = 0.53
__It is 53%. Also it is (1 -  False Positive Rate)__

* Precision: When it predicts __Up__, how often is it correct?
TP/predicted __Up__ = 557/605 = ~0.92

* Prevalence: How often does the __Up__ condition actually occur in our sample?
actual Up/total Up = 987/1089 = ~0.906


### (d) Now fit the logistic regression model using a training data period from 1990 to 2008, with Lag2 as the only predictor. Compute the confusion matrix and the overall fraction of correct predictions for the held out data (that is, the data from 2009 and 2010).

```
> ## 1.d
> train =(Year <2009)
> Weekly.2009=Weekly[!train,]
> Weekly.2009=Weekly[!train,]
> Direction.2009= Direction[!train]
> glm.fits=glm(Direction~Lag2,data=Weekly,family=binomial,subset=train)
> summary (glm.fits)

Call:
glm(formula = Direction ~ Lag2, family = binomial, data = Weekly, 
    subset = train)

Deviance Residuals: 
   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  
-1.536  -1.264   1.021   1.091   1.368  

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)   
(Intercept)  0.20326    0.06428   3.162  0.00157 **
Lag2         0.05810    0.02870   2.024  0.04298 * 
---
Signif. codes:  
0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)

    Null deviance: 1354.7  on 984  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance: 1350.5  on 983  degrees of freedom
AIC: 1354.5

Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
```

#### Predict on 2009 - 2010 and print confusion matrix
```
> glm.probs =predict(glm.fits,Weekly.2009 , type="response")
> glm.pred=rep ("Down" ,104)
> glm.pred[glm.probs >.5]="Up"
> table(glm.pred ,Direction.2009)
        Direction.2009
glm.pred Down Up
    Down    9  5
    Up     34 56
> mean(glm.pred== Direction.2009)
[1] 0.625
> mean(glm.pred!= Direction.2009)
[1] 0.375
> 
```
* Accuracy: Overall, how often is the classifier correct?
(True Down +True Up)/total = (9+56)/104 = 0.625
__The 62.2% of time the classifier able to accuratly predict.__

* Misclassification Rate: Overall, how often is it wrong?
(Fase Down + False Up)/total = (34+5)/104 = 0.375
__Error Rate is 37.5%.__

* For weeks when the market trend is up-wards, the model is right ~91.80% of the time (56/(56+5))
* For weeks when the market goes down, the model is correct only ~20.93% of the time (9/(9+34))


### (e) Repeat (d) using LDA.
```
> # 1.e

> lda.fit
Call:
lda(Direction ~ Lag2, data = Smarket, subset = train)

0.4834206 0.5165794 

Group means:

Down  0.04272202
Up   -0.02882095

### (f) Repeat (d) using QDA.
### (g) Repeat (d) using KNN with K = 1.
### (h) Which of these methods appears to provide the best results on this data?
### (i) Experiment with different combinations of predictors, including possible transformations and interactions, for each of the methods. Report the variables, method, and associated confusion matrix that appears to provide the best results on the held out data. Note that you should also experiment with values for K in the KNN classifier.
